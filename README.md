# SimpleGAMultiSig

**SimpleGAMultiSig** is a multi-signature smart contract implemented in the Sophia programming language for the æternity blockchain platform. It provides a decentralized and secure framework for managing multi-signature transactions based on generalized accounts (GAs). This repository contains the source code for the smart contract, along with documentation and usage guidelines.

## Features

- **Multi-Signature Transactions:** Enable multiple authorized signers to propose, confirm, refuse, or authorize transactions.
- **Fee Protection:** Configure fee protection parameters to prevent unauthorized transactions with excessive fees.
- **Loan Management:** Functionality for lending and borrowing money, with support for loan tracking and repayment.
- **Transaction Consensus:** Transactions require consensus from a predefined number of signers before authorization and execution.
- **Secure and Audited:** Follows best practices for security and has been audited to ensure robustness and reliability.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed documentation explaining the contract's functionalities, entrypoints, and usage examples.

## Usage

To deploy the `SimpleGAMultiSig` smart contract on the æternity blockchain platform, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/albertisaac12/Backened-AES-updated-code-GAmultisig-with-Lending]
   ```

2. Deploy the contract using the æternity blockchain SDK or web IDE.
   
3. Customize the contract parameters, such as the number of required confirmations, fee protection settings, and initial signers, according to your requirements.

4. Integrate the contract into your decentralized applications (dApps) or use it as a standalone solution for multi-party transactions.
